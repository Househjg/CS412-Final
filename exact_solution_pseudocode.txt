Function max_3Sat(num_variables, clauses)
    Initialize variables array with 1 for each variable
    max <-- 0

    Generate all possible combinations of truth values for the variables
    For each combination
        Calculate the number of satisfied clauses using max_3Sat_helper(combination, clauses)
        If all clauses are satisfied
            Return this combination and the total number of clauses
        Else if this combination satisfies more clauses than previous best combination
            max <-- current combination

    Return the best combination and the max count of satisfied clauses

Function max_3Sat_helper(variables, clauses)
    Initialize clauses_satisfied as 0

    For each clause in clauses
        For each literal in the clause
            Determine the index of the variable corresponding to the literal
            If the sign of the literal matches the value assigned in variables
                Increment the count of clauses_satisfied
                Break out of the loop (proceed to the next clause)

    Return clauses_satisfied
